# Referencing `coqdoc` generated definitions

Because this documentation lives in the same repository as the source code, after `coqdoc` has been run, we can refer to source code such as [the definition of `tint_Z32`](/coqdoc/DeepSpec.core.HyperTypeInst.html#tint_Z32) like this:

<iframe style="width:100%" src="/coqdoc/DeepSpec.core.HyperTypeInst.html#tint_Z32"></iframe>

This would continue to work even if `DeepSpec.core.HyperTypeInst.v` gets re-arranged a little.
