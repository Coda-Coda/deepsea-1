(** * Syntax of types *)

(** Compcert C types are similar to those of C.  They include numeric types,
  pointers, arrays, function types, and composite types (struct and 
  union).  Numeric types (integers and floats) fully specify the
  bit size of the type.  An integer type is a pair of a signed/unsigned
  flag and a bit size: 8, 16, or 32 bits, or the special [IBool] size
  standing for the C99 [_Bool] type.  64-bit integers are treated separately. *)
