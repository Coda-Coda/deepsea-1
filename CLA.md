## CompCert Licence

You as the contributor retain the Copyright related to your Contributions but you do agree to licence all Contributions under the [CompCert Licence](./CompCert-LICENSE.txt) while noting that this does not prevent you from also licencing these Contributions differently elsewhere as long as doing so does not breach the [CompCert Licence](./CompCert-LICENSE.txt).

## About this Contributor Licence Agreement
This contributor licence agreement is loosely based upon one generated at https://contributoragreements.org/ and is used under the [CC BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) licence. It has been modified, primarily to trim it down for simplicity.

The motivation for this contributor licence agreement is to be open to collaboration on this repository while continuing to comply with clause 4 of the [INRIA Non-Commercial License Agreement for the CompCert verified compiler](./CompCert-LICENSE.txt), with the end goal of improving and doing research related to the DeepSEA system (which is based upon the [INRIA CompCert research project](https://compcert.org)).
